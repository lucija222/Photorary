## About
### API
- **API** used for data has a quota of 50 calls per hour. If you encounter issues, the quota has been hit. Please try again on the next full hour. <br />

### Testing
- **Browsers:** Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and MS Edge <br />
- **OS:** Windows and Android <br />

### Design
- The design and idea for the app are my own. I wanted to create a setting which resembles phographs displayed on the wall in a cosy space. <br />
- The SVGS at the bottom of the page are custom made using Inkscape. <br />
- The lamp has a feature to toggle the light on and off. In the future, this feature might be expanded to enable the dark mode. <br />

### Layout
- The photo grid has a dynamic width and number of columns, allowing the app to display elegantly on any viewport width starting from 223 pixels, however it can easily be adjusted to accomodate even smaller viewports as well. <br />
- Each column in the grid contains a flexbox container which accomodates images of all sizes and ratios while preserving space and ommiting unwanted gaps. <br />
- Header is fixated at the top of the app for ease of access. <br />
